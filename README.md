This is an Open Source Project that will help you track your improvements in the game of tennis.

We start with building a ball machine. The ball machine has 3 parts
1. Launcher Sub-System
2. Movement Sub-System
3. Understanding System

Launcher Sub-System:
Default connections
define Bott_RPWM 3
define Bott_LPWM 4

define Top_RPWM 5
define Top_LPWM 6

const int Top_R_IS = A2; 
const int Top_L_IS = A3; 

const int Bott_R_IS = A0; 
const int Bott_L_IS = A1;
